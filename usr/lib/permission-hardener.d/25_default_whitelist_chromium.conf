## Chrome/Chromium now uses namespace-based sandboxing rather than a SUID
## sandbox for most use cases, and while the SUID sandbox is still technically
## supported [1], it's also virtually unused [2]. Chromium still works fine
## when it is stripped of its SUID bit and rendered no longer executable,
## and opening `chrome://sandbox` while in this state shows that sandboxing is
## still working perfectly fine.
