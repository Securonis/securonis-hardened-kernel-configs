## Apparently specific to Debian, there isn't actually any Git repo with this
## code in it, it's just a "floating" package in the Debian archive. Written by
## the same person who maintains the package. Almost certainly cannot be
## disabled without causing serious problems, but may be worth auditing.
## (Worthy of note, it doesn't seem this program takes any user input, but
## relies solely on the calling user's UID and GID, though this could require
## further review.)

## Without this, Xfce fails to start with a dbus-launch error.
