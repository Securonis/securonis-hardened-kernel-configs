## Used for SSH client key management
## https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/openssh-client/ssh-agent.1.en.html
## Debian installs ssh-agent with setgid permissions (2755) and with
## _ssh as the group to help mitigate ptrace attacks that could extract
## private keys from the agent's memory.

## Used only for SSH host-based authentication
## https://linux.die.net/man/8/ssh-keysign
## Needed to allow access to the machine's host key for use in the
## authentication process. This is a non-default method of authenticating to
## SSH, and is likely rarely used, thus this should be safe to disable.
