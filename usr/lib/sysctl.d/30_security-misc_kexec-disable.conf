## KSPP=no: not (currently) compliant with recommendations by the KSPP
## If there is no explicit KSPP compliance notice, the setting is not mentioned by the KSPP.

## NOTE:
## This configuration is in a dedicated file because the ram-wipe package
## requires kexec. However, ram-wipe cannot ship a config file
## /etc/sysctl.d/40_ram-wipe.conf that sets 'kernel.kexec_load_disabled=0'.
## Once systemd-sysctl.service has set 'kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1',
## it cannot be undone without a reboot. This is an upstream Linux security feature.
## Instead, ram-wipe will config-package-dev 'hide' this file.

## Disables kexec, which can be used to replace the running kernel.
## Useful for live kernel patching without rebooting.
